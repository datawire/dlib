// Package dcontext provides tools for dealing with separate hard/soft
// cancellation of Contexts.
//
// Given
//
//    softCtx := WithSoftness(hardCtx)
//
// then
//
//    // The soft Context being done signals the end of "normal
//    // operation", and the program should initiate a graceful
//    // shutdown; a "soft shutdown".  In other words, it means, "You
//    // should start shutting down now."
//    <-softCtx.Done()
//
//    // The hard Context being done signals that the time for a
//    // graceful shutdown has passed and that the program should
//    // terminate *right now*, not-so-gracefully; a "hard shutdown".
//    // In other words, it means, "If you haven't finished shutting
//    // down yet, then you should hurry it up."
//    <-HardContext(softCtx).Done()
//
// When writing code that makes use of a Context, which Context should
// you use, the soft Context or the hard Context?
//
// - For most normal-operation code, you should use the soft Context
// (since this is most code, I recommend that you name it just `ctx`,
// not `softCtx`).
//
// - For shutdown/cleanup code, you should use the hard Context
// (`dcontext.HardContext(ctx)`).
//
// - For normal-operation code that explicitly may persist in to the
// post-shutdown-initiated grace-period, it may be appropriate to use
// the hard Context.
//
//
//
// Design principles
//
// - The lifetimes of the various stages (normal operation, shutdown)
// should be signaled with Contexts, rather than with bare channels.
// Because each stage may want to call a function that takes a
// Context, there should be a Context whose lifetime is scoped to the
// lifetime of that stage.  If things were signaled with bare
// channels, things taking a Context might shut down too late or too
// early (depending on whether the Context represented hard shutdown
// (as it does for pkg/supervisor) or soft shutdown).
//
// - A soft graceful shutdown is enough fully signal a shutdown, and
// if everything is well-behaved will perform a full shutdown;
// analogous to how clicking the "X" button in the upper corner of a
// window *should* be enough to quit the program.  The harder
// not-so-graceful is the fallback for when something isn't
// well-behaved (whether that be local code or a remote network
// service) and isn't shutting down in an acceptable time; analogous
// to the window manager prompting you "the program is not responding,
// would you like to force-kill it?"
//
// - There should only be one thing to pass around.  For much of
// amb-sidecar's life (2019-02 to 2020-08), it used two separate
// Contexts for hard and soft cancellation, both explicitly passed
// around.  This turned out to be clunky: (1) it was far too easy to
// accidentally use the wrong one; (2) the hard Context wouldn't have
// Values attached to the soft Context or vice-versa, so if you cared
// about both Values and cancellation, there were situations where
// *both* were the wrong choice.
//
// - It should be simple and safe to interoperate with
// dcontext-unaware code; code needn't be dcontext-aware if it doesn't
// have fancy shutdown logic.  This is one of the reasons why (in
// conjunction with "A soft shutdown is enough to fully signal a
// shutdown") the main Context that gets passed around is the soft
// Context and you need to call `dcontext.HardContext(ctx)` to get the
// hard Context; the hard-shutdown case is opt-in to facilitate code
// that has shutdown logic that might not be instantaneous and might
// need to be cut short if it takes too long (such as a server waiting
// for client connections to drain).  Simple code with simple roughly
// instantaneous shutdown logic need not be concerned about hard
// Contexts and shutdown getting cut short.
//
//
//
// Interfacing dcontext-aware code with dcontext-unaware code
//
// When dcontext-aware code passes the soft Context to
// dcontext-unaware code, then that callee code will shutdown at the
// beginning of the shutdown grace period.  This is correct, because
// the beginning of that grace period means "start shutting down" (on
// the above principles); if the callee code is dcontext-unaware, then
// shutting down when told to start shutting down is tautologically
// the right thing.  If it isn't the right thing, then the code is
// code that needs to be made dcontext-aware (or adapted to be
// dcontext-aware, as in the HTTP server example).
//
// When dcontext-unaware code passes a hard (normal) Context to
// dcontext-aware code, then that callee code will observe the
// <-ctx.Done() and <-HardContext(ctx).Done() occurring at the same
// instant.  This is correct, because the caller code doesn't allow
// any grace period between "start shutting down" and "you need to
// finish shutting down now", so both of those are in the same
// instant.
//
// Because of these two properties, it is the correct thing for...
//
// - dcontext-aware caller code to just always pass the soft Context
// to things, regardless of whether the code being called it is
// dcontext-aware or not, and for
//
// - dcontext-aware callee code to just always assume that the Context
// it has received is a soft Context (if for whatever reason it really
// cares, it can check if `ctx == dcontext.HardContext(ctx)`).
