// Package dlog implements a generic logger facade.
//
// There are three first-class things of value in this package:
//
// First: The Logger interface.  This is a simple structured logging
// interface that is mostly trivial to implement on top of most
// logging backends, and allows library code to not need to care about
// what specific logging system the calling program uses.
//
// Second: The WithLogger and WithField functions for affecting the
// logging for a context.
//
// Third: The actual logging functions.  If you are writing library
// code and want to log things, then you should take a context.Context
// as an argument, and then call dlog.{Level}{,f,ln}(ctx, args) to
// log.

// Logger is a generic logging interface that most loggers implement,

// Panic logging options.  Do proper error handling!  Return those
// errors!
